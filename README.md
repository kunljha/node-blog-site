## Node-Blog-Site

This a an fully server-side web-app built with `NodeJS` and `Express` and I integrated `MongoDB Atlas` to use as a
database for it.

It is a Blogging site where users can Read Blogs, Write Blogs,
etc, and users need to first signup in the application to use it which was implement using ***JWT*** authentication.
